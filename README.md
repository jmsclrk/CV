</div>

A Makers Academy graduate, with two live freelance projects, who has been employed as an Integration Engineer for the past year. I'm a full stack software developer combining strong technical knowledge with ample training in favoured coding practices, backed by 4 years in broadcast within production/project management roles.
<br>

## BACKGROUND ##

Studying at Makers instilled in me many of the best coding practices. I am trained in, and am a true advocate of: agile development, test-driven development and object-oriented programming. Makers also emphasise the importance of wellbeing and provide invaluable workshops that further built upon my already strong teamwork abilities and empathetic nature. 

For the past year I've worked at the online learning company, Avado, as an Integration Engineer where I have greatly improved and refined my backend skills. During this time I have demonstrated my commitment to growing as a full stack engineer by developing and deploying two projects that required a heavy focus on upskilling my frontend abilities: a React Native fitness app (available on iOS devices via the App Store) and a React website for a small food business based in Hackney, London. 

I am looking to bring my drive, dedication and user-focused approach to a team who are: passionate about good coding practices, have strong team dynamics, and provide a supportive learning environment that encourages further development.

## SKILLS ##
**Communication + Teamwork** <br>
Coming from a production/project management role, ensuring and maintaining effective communication within the team was one of my main focuses. I often designed communication workflows and connected different departments, always working towards the bigger picture and doing what's best for the team. 

**Attention to Detail** <br>
This was an essential skill while planning all logistical, financial and technological aspects of a production, ensuring and reporting cost efficiency, building and managing a balanced team, and ensuring health and safety whilst on site. 

**Quick Study** <br>
Picked up many new technologies and coding languages at Avado, quickly becoming autonomous and comofortable using them to a high standard. Led a project determining and quickly becoming well versed in the full legal requirements to comply with strict French Employment Laws when sending a large number of employees, freelancers and subcontractors to work in France for the 2018 Ryder Cup. 

**Positive** <br>
I bring a positive energy and outlook to teams that I work with. I remain calm in high-stress situations, helping to restore team motivation and drive focus towards effective and timely solutions. I have helped resolve conflicts between team members and encouraged others who have lost confidence. 

**Adaptable** <br>
Managing diverse production crews ranging from 20 to 250 people in Europe and the United States meant that I had to be flexible in my approach to different members of the team. I also needed to have an in-depth knowledge of everyone’s roles and all resources available ready to step into a number of different positions in order to counter unexpected problems.
<br>

**Production Coordinator at BBC (May 2016 - Nov 2017)** <br>
Developed close relationships with all departments and service-providing companies as the primary production contact, internally and externally. Countered unexpected problems during production with both instant and longer-term solutions to resume filming immediately and also prevent recurrence.

## INTERESTS ##
**Health and Fitness:** Dedicated gym-goer and runner who often takes part in organised charity events, successfully sticking to a strict fitness routine around a busy work schedule. 

**Food:** Foodie and avid home cook, my mixed European and Asian background exposed me to a diverse range of cuisines from a young age. I'm always keen to try out the latest food spots, cook something from a cuisine I haven't tried before or add something new to my ever-growing rack of herbs and spices.
