</div>

A graduate from Makers Academy, with two live personal projects, that has been employed as a Integration Engineer for the past year. I'm a full stack software developer combining strong technical knowledge with ample training in favoured coding practices, backed by 4 years in broadcast within production/project management roles
<br>

## BACKGROUND ##

Studying at Makers instilled in me many of the best coding practices. I am trained in, and am a true advocate of, agile development, test-driven development and object-oriented programming. Makers also emphasise the importance of wellbeing, providing invaluable workshops that further built upon my already strong teamwork abilities and empathetic nature. 

For the past year I have worked at the online learning company, Avado, as an Integration Engineer - a role that has greatly improved and refined my backend skills. During this time I have demonstrated my commitment to growing as a full stack engineer by developing and deploying two projects that required a heavy focus on upskilling my frontend abilities - a React Native fitness app (available on iOS devices via the App Store) and a React app for a small food business based in Hackney. 

I am looking to bring my drive, dedication and user-focused approach to a team who are: passionate about good coding practices, have strong team dynamics, and provide a supportive learning environment that encourages further development.

## SKILLS ##
**Communication + Teamwork** <br>
Coming from a production/project management role, ensuring and maintaining effective communication within the team was one of my main focuses. I often designed communication workflows and connected different departments, always working towards the bigger picture and for the greater good of the team. 

**Attention to Detail** <br>
This was an essential skill while planning all logistical, financial and technological aspects of a production, ensuring and reporting cost efficiency, building and managing a balanced team, and ensuring health and safety whilst on site. 

**Quick Study** <br>
Led a project to determine the full legal requirements that were necessary to comply with strict French Employment Laws when sending a large number of employees, freelancers and subcontractors to France for the 2018 Ryder Cup. Had to quickly become well versed in the full legal requirements, working closely with Sky’s Legal and Tax departments to develop an efficient process that would fully cover everyone attending the event and be easily repeated for future Sky events in France.

**Positive** <br>
I bring a positive energy and outlook to teams that I work with. In high-stress situations I maintain clarity, helping to pick the team up and drive towards effective and timely solutions. I have helped resolve conflicts between team members and encouraged others who have lost confidence. 

**Adaptable** <br>
Managing diverse production crews ranging from 20 to 250 people in Europe and the United States meant that I had to be flexible in my approach to different members of the team. I also needed to have an in-depth knowledge of everyone’s roles and all resources available ready to step into a number of different positions in order to counter unexpected problems.
<br>

## EXPERIENCE ##
#### BROADCAST / TELEVISION CAREER ####
**Production Manager / Coordinator at Sky Sports (Nov 2017 - Jul 2019)** <br>
End-to-end supervision of the complete production process for golf sporting events covered by Sky Sports. Worked closely with the Head of Golf to accommodate for up to four golf tournaments per week, determining the scale of production and facilitating the delivery of live coverage to customers whether on site or based at Sky Studios.

**Production Coordinator at BBC (May 2016 - Nov 2017)** <br>
Developed close relationships with all departments and service-providing companies as the primary production contact, internally and externally. Countered unexpected problems during production with both instant and longer-term solutions to resume filming immediately and also prevent recurrence.

**Development Researcher at Hungry Bear Media (May 2015 - May 2016)** <br>
Ensured the efficient running of the office by centrally supporting all ongoing productions. Managed the work schedules of three busy executives and the development team.
<br>

## INTERESTS ##
**Health and Fitness:** Dedicated gym-goer and runner who often takes part in organised charity events, successfully sticking to a strict fitness routine around a busy work schedule. 

**Food:** Foodie and avid home cook, my mixed European and Asian background exposed me to a diverse range of cuisines from a young age. I'm always keen to try out the latest food spots, cook something from a cuisine I haven't tried before or add something new to my ever-growing rack of herbs and spices.
